# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add real-time human detection and blurring capabilities to the video presentation application. The system will automatically detect human figures in the video feed and apply a blur effect to them while keeping the rest of the video content clear. This is particularly useful for privacy protection during screen recordings or presentations where people may appear in the background.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video presenter, I want the system to automatically blur human figures in my video feed, so that I can maintain privacy while still showing my environment or screen content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the video feed is active THEN the system SHALL continuously detect human figures in real-time
2. WHEN a human figure is detected THEN the system SHALL apply a blur effect to the detected region
3. WHEN multiple humans are present THEN the system SHALL blur all detected human figures simultaneously
4. WHEN no humans are detected THEN the system SHALL display the video feed without any blur effects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle the human blurring feature on and off, so that I can control when privacy protection is applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the blur toggle control THEN the system SHALL enable or disable human blurring
2. WHEN human blurring is disabled THEN the system SHALL display the original unprocessed video feed
3. WHEN human blurring is enabled THEN the system SHALL resume real-time human detection and blurring
4. WHEN the toggle state changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the current state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust the intensity of the blur effect, so that I can customize the level of privacy protection based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts the blur intensity slider THEN the system SHALL update the blur effect strength in real-time
2. WHEN blur intensity is set to minimum THEN the system SHALL apply a light blur effect
3. WHEN blur intensity is set to maximum THEN the system SHALL apply a strong blur effect that completely obscures human features
4. WHEN blur intensity changes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance without lag

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the human blurring to work smoothly without significantly impacting video performance, so that my presentation quality remains high.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN human blurring is active THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 24 FPS video processing
2. WHEN processing video frames THEN the system SHALL complete human detection within 50ms per frame
3. WHEN applying blur effects THEN the system SHALL not introduce visible lag or stuttering
4. IF the system cannot maintain performance THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade by reducing detection frequency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual indicators showing when human blurring is active, so that I know the privacy protection is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN human blurring is enabled THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator in the UI
2. WHEN humans are actively being blurred THEN the system SHALL show a status indicator
3. WHEN the blur feature encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display an error state indicator
4. WHEN hovering over status indicators THEN the system SHALL show tooltip information about the current state
